This project is 100% [vibe coded](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/). All the code is generated by AI, and I don't review the code (just the functionality). A lot of it is pretty bad, but it works, and my goal is to test the limits of the technology (and have fun!) rather than to produce a viable game. 

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
